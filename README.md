# Iris-Flower-Classification-Using-Machine-Learning-
The aim of this project is to classify iris flowers into three species — Setosa, Versicolor, and Virginica — based on the size of their petals and sepals. A machine learning model is trained to accurately predict the flower species based on these features.
